<p>DATABASE IS IN THE "resources/database" FOLDER! (Sqlite)<br>

## Post/Create operations:

- Select **POST** method and input:

#### Adding actors example: (api/actors)

```

    "birthDate": "1975-12-31" (VALID BIRTHDATE: YYYY-MM-DD)
}
```

#### Adding movies example: (api/movies)

```
{
    "title": "example",
    "releaseYear": 2010,
    "duration": 148,
    "actorIds": [1,2],  // IDs (Delete if you don't need to add actors)
